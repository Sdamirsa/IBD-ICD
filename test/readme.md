One gastroenterologist performed colonoscopies with 13 years of experience using an Olympus 160 device (653*560 pixel image output). Reports with the term "mayo" were retrieved, and classified into m1, m2, and m3, and normal colonoscopy studies were collected. To create image-level labels, images were labelled by an MD and a GI fellow, a gastroenterologist resolved discrepancies. A senior gastroenterologist with 10 years of experience in IBD management reviewed all image-level labels.
