One gastroenterologist performed colonoscopies with 13 years of experience using an Olympus 160 device (653*560 pixel image output). Reports with the term "mayo" were retrieved, and classified into m1, m2, m3, and normal colonoscopy studies were collected. Initially labelled images as m1, m2, m3, and Nl, and then a GI fellow did the same evaluation. A gastroenterologist with 10 years of experience reviewed all image-level labels.
